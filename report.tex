	\section{Introduction}
	The goal of this assignment was to create a tile-matching game in the unity engine, the game needed 	to contain a rectangular grid of cells each containing various cell items; these items can be jewels, blockers or sand which have different interaction and falling rules. Jewels can be swapped with adjacent jewels, jewels can also be eliminated if they are either in 3 or more of a kind in a line or a 2x2 square of a kind, elimination will take precedent over a swap. There are also usable items that can be attached to jewels and perform different effects once activated (jewel elimination); bomb, color bomb, concretion and fragile. The Level is won if the player manages to eliminate all the jewels from the grid or lost if they run out of swaps and no eliminations remain.
